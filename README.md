# What Is Gary Bot?
Gary bot is a meme-y and functional bot to be used for /r/FCCincinnati's Discord server. The intended use is to be a replacement for an old bot that is no longer hosted, as well as a easily customizable bot that can add or remove code as needed by the Discord. Written in JavaScript using Discord.JS, Gary Bot is the first fully functional code that I (Blod) has written and been used publicly. A lot of help as well as server hosting was done by Bmulley.

# How Does Gary Bot Run?
Gary Bot is ran on an Ubuntu based VM graciously hosted for free by Bmulley. The server has regularly scheduled git pulls to determine if the master branch has changed, and if so pulls down and applies those changes.  It utilizes pm2 for service uptime and monitoring, to ensure that the service will restart if it dies for any reason.
