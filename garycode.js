The Late Great Gordan Ramsey himself even said 'You don't put fucking pineapple on pizza'. Quoted, word for word. Like how much of a disgusting human being to say that pineapple is okay on pizza, after one of the world's greatest chefs told you otherwise. It's wrong, Completely and udderly wrong. The Italians cry at what we've made pizza, just a disgusting mess of dough, cheese, and pizza sauce. Topped with whatever we want, no matter the flavor. If we want it, we get it on.
