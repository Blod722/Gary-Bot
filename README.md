# What is Gary Bot?
Gary bot is a meme-y and functional bot to be used for /r/FCCincinnati's Discord server. The intended use is to be a replacement for an old bot that is never hosted, as well as a easily customizable bot that can add or remove code as needed by the Discord. Written in JavaScript using Discord.JS, Gary Bot is the first fully functional code that I (Blod) has written and been used publicly.
