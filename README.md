# Gary Bot
"Because that's what his name is."

Created with love by Blod#6563 and Bmulley#4379 for /r/FCCincinnati's Discord https://discord.gg/Bt6ytSQ

# What Is Gary Bot?
Gary bot is a meme-y and functional bot to be used for /r/FCCincinnati's Discord server. The intended use is to be a replacement for an old bot that is no longer hosted, as well as a easily customizable bot that can add or remove code as needed by the Discord. Written in JavaScript using Discord.JS, Gary Bot is the first fully functional code that I (Blod) has written and been used publicly. A lot of help as well as server hosting was done by Bmulley.

# How Does Gary Bot Run?
Gary Bot is ran on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS based VM graciously hosted for free by Bmulley using Microsoft Azure. The server uses SCP Protocol for transfering files, and SSH Protocol to run the code. Since SSH requires both clients to have a connection for code to run, the bot is not yet 24/7. Bmulley is currently making a Service Script to allow the bot to be run at all times.

# Licensing
Although the bot is Open Source, I do request that you don't recopy the code in its entirety. I have no issue with you using bits and pieces for your own projects.
